# DSA.3: Recursion

## 1. Write a recursive algorithm that takes in `n` as input, and returns `n!`

5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120

0! = 1


# DSA.1: Trees

## 1. Write a function that takes a binary tree and finds the sum of each node in the tree. (Implement Tree) 

                          3
                     2         5
                      
                  2    4    1     7
                  
     
3 + 2 + 5 + 2 + 4 + 1 + 7 = 24
