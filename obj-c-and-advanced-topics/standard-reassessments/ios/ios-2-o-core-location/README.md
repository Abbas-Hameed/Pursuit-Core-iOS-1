# ios-2-o: Core Location

Refactor your project from [here](https://github.com/joinpursuit/Pursuit-Core-iOS-WeatherApp) to prompt the user for their location.  If permission is granted, persist their location to User Defaults and load the weather for their location.  If permission is not granted, show the screen that allows them to input their Zip Code manually.
