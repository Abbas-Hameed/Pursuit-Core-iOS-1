//S1)
let myGreeting = "Hello, "
let myName = "Ben"

//Without using string interpolation, print out a string that combines myGreeting and myName.

//S2)
```swift
let myArray = ["Hi", "there,", "how","is","it","going?"]
```
//write code that prints out myArray as a single string separated by spaces.


//S3)
//Write code that prints out all the numbers from 1 to 10 as a single string.  (Hint: the String() function can convert an int to a string)

//S4)
//Write code that prints out all the even numbers from 5 to 51 as a single string.

//S5)
//Write code that prints out every number ending in 4 between 1 and 60 as a single string.


//S6)
//Print each character in the string "Hello world!"

//S7) 
//Using '.characters' and loop, print the last character in the string below
```swift
let myStringSeven = "Hello world!"
```

//S8)
//Write code that switches on a string.  If the string's length is even, print out every character.  If the string's length is odd, print out every other character


//S9) Initialize a String with a character. Show that it is a Character, and not another String, you're using 
to initialize it.

//Unicode exercises

//U1) Build five pairs of canonically equivalent strings, the first of each being a pre-composed character and
the second being one that uses combinable unicode scalars. Show that they are equivalent.
