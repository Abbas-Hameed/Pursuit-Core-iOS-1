# Standards:
* ```UIImagePickerController```

# Objectives
* Students will be able to integrate ```UIImagePickerController``` into an app.
* Students will be introduced to how to scan, read and port Objective-C code.

We're going to walk and chew bubblegum this time, learning about the ```UIImagePickerController``` from 
[sample code from Apple](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/samplecode/PhotoPicker/Introduction/Intro.html).
The problem is that the best (or as far as I can tell, only) sample code from them is written in Objective-C,
so we'll have to get the information we need from the Objective-C project as we implement it in Swift.

## Objective-C
* [Objective C Cheatsheet](https://github.com/iwasrobbed/Objective-C-CheatSheet)
	> Hardly a cheatsheet. More like a quick reference.

* [Another non-cheatsheet](http://www.dummies.com/software/objective-c-for-dummies-cheat-sheet/)
	> I hate the dummies brand but I like this bit about objects and messages:
	>
	> Object-oriented programming languages enable you to declare classes, create derived classes 
	> (subclass), and send messages to the objects instantiated from a class. This is the essence 
	> of object-oriented programming and part of the object-oriented extensions that Objective-C adds to C. 

* [An actual cheatsheet from good ol' RW](https://www.raywenderlich.com/downloads/RW-Objective-C-Cheatsheet-v-1-5.pdf)
	> Old, but solid, just like Objective-C

* http://fuckingblocksyntax.com/
	> A classic
