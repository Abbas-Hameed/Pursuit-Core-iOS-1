```swift
//Example Problem: Declare a constant called "c4qHQ" that holds the string "Long Island City". Print "c4qHQ"

let c4qHQ = "Long Island City"
print(c4qHQ)

//Problem 1.Declare a variable string called "str" that holds the string "Hello, Playground"


//Problem 2.Declare a variable integer called "one" that holds the value 1


//Problem 3.Change "one" value to 4


//Problem 4.Change "one" value to 1.2 (hint: you might need to change "one"'s declaration first)

//Problem 5.Declare a let constant string called "name" that holds your full name.

//Problem 6.Create a let constant called "age" and give it the value of your age.

//Problem 7.Uncomment the constant called "aboutMe" below. Insert the correct constants you created inside the (). Print "aboutMe".

    //let aboutMe = "My name is \() and I'm \() years old."

nt or variable, then print.

    //let townDescription = "My hometown is \() and has a population of \(). There are \() schools in town."
