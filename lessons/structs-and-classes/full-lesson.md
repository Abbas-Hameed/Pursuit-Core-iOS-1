# Lecture

From the Apple documentation:

> An instance of a class is traditionally known as an object. However, Swift classes and structures are 
> much closer in functionality than in other languages, and much of this chapter describes functionality 
> that can apply to instances of either a class or a structure type. Because of this, the more general 
> term instance is used.

## Structures and Classes

From the Apple documentation:

> ###Comparing Classes and Structures
>
> Classes and structures in Swift have many things in common. Both can:
> 
> * Define properties to store values
> * Define methods to provide functionality
> * Define subscripts to provide access to their values using subscript syntax
> * Define initializers to set up their initial state
> * Be extended to expand their functionality beyond a default implementation
> * Conform to protocols to provide standard functionality of a certain kind
> For more information, see Properties, Methods, Subscripts, Initialization, Extensions, and Protocols.
> 
> Classes have additional capabilities that structures do not:
> 
> * Inheritance enables one class to inherit the characteristics of another.
> * Type casting enables you to check and interpret the type of a class instance at runtime.
> * Deinitializers enable an instance of a class to free up any resources it has assigned.
> * Reference counting allows more than one reference to a class instance.

### Method Parameter Names

### Type Methods

```static``` in ```struct```s and ```class``` in ```class```.
