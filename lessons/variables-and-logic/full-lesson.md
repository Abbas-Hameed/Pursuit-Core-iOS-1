#Lecture
##Intro
##Types

Swift is a language with strong types and type inference

```swift
var favoritePeanut = "Charlie Brown"
var theAnswer = 42
var singleFare = 2.75
```
##Variables and Constants
Swift distinguishes between variables and constants

The distinction is a basic computing idea, but in other languages is usually  captured and communicated by means of convention, not built into the language.

We do it to protect the value from changing, which also makes the code more readable. When another programmer, or future you sees that something is a constant you know it's not meant to change.

You might have visualized a variable as a box that can hold something; the box is the value. A constant's value is set the same way but after it's been set it can't be changed. The advantage of this will become increasingly apparent as we use it. At first, it might be easiest to think of its applications in math.

```swift
let pi = 3.1415926536
let e = 2.718281828459
let c = 299_792_458
``` 

These are mathematical and scientific constants (CS borrows the word) and they never change. 

But in a program there are cases where you want something, once set, to not be reset. 

**Discussion**: What does the class currently know about the topic? Why do we care about this topic? 

Give a high level overview of the topic:
- and
- add
- some
- insightful
- bulletpoints

##Demo
Go over code examples, e.g. demo the following:
- `slice` / `splice`
- `push` / `unshift`
- `pop` / `shift`
- `concat`

```javascript
function(){
    console.log("Also include some code examples, if you'd like")
}
```
