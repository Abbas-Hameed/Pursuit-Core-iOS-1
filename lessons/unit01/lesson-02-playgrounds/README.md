## Playgrounds

Playgrounds as the name implies allows you to view the result of code you type in real time. If you've worked with REPL (read evaluate print loop) it's very similar but with advantages. For example you can view the progress of you code over time. Developers often use playgrounds for prototyping of testing out their code. That same codebase can then be moved to a project when testing is done. 

Prior to Playgrounds and Swift a way code was tested in a similar fashion was using macOS command line tool in Xcode. This provided a main.swift file that can be edited and run without having a full blown app for testing. Playgrounds is a wrapper around main.swift.
