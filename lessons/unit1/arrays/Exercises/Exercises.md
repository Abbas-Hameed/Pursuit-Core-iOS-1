### Question 16.
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

### Question 19.
Identify if there are 3 integers in the following array that sum to 10. If so, print them. If there are multiple triplets, print all possible triplets.

```swift
var tripleSumArr = [-20,-14, -8,-5,-3,-2,1,2,3,4,9,15,20,30]
```

<details>
<summary><b>Solution</b></summary>

```swift
for x in 0..<tripleSumArr.count {
    for y in (x+1)..<tripleSumArr.count {
        for z in (y+1)..<tripleSumArr.count {
            if tripleSumArr[x] + tripleSumArr[y] + tripleSumArr[z] == 10 {
                let sum = tripleSumArr[x] + tripleSumArr[y] + tripleSumArr[z]
            
                print("\(tripleSumArr[x]) + \(tripleSumArr[y]) + \(tripleSumArr[z]) = \(sum)")
            }
        }
    }
}

// More efficient solution:

/*
 1) First, we check to see if the current triplet adds up to 10.
 
 2) We will move all the pointers over one at a time, starting with the one closest to the right. 
 When it reaches the end, we increment the second pointer over and reset the last one to be next 
 to the second.
 
 3) If the second pointer reaches the last pointer, we'll increment the first pointer over and 
 reset the positions of the other two back to the beginning, next to the right side of the first.
 
 4) When the pointers can't be moved any further without overlapping (i.e., when all 3 pointers 
 will be stacked on the right), then we should end the loop
 */

 while x < tripleSumArr.count - 2 {
    
    // 1
    if tripleSumArr[x] + tripleSumArr[y] + tripleSumArr[z] == 10 {
        let whileSum = tripleSumArr[x] + tripleSumArr[y] + tripleSumArr[z]
        
        print("\(tripleSumArr[x]) + \(tripleSumArr[y]) + \(tripleSumArr[z]) = \(whileSum)")
    }
    
    // 2
    z += 1
    
    if z > tripleSumArr.count - 1 {
        y += 1
        z = y + 1
        
        // 3
        if y > tripleSumArr.count - 2 {
            x += 1
            y = x + 1
            z = y + 1
        }
    }
}
