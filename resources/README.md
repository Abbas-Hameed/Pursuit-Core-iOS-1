### Swift

The language we're learning in this course is Swift 3.1. Because Swift is a new language it is changing. Apple has introduced Swift 4.0 but it's in beta at the time of this writing. The link below is the official version of the language we'll be using. We will update it if necessary

[The Swift Programming Language (Swift 4.0)](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/index.html)
Oddly, even though Swift 4.0 is still in beta, Apple has replaced the 3.1 documentation with 4.0.
