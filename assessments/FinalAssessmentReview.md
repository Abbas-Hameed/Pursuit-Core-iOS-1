### Big O Notation

- Explain the runtime of functions
- Rank runtimes relative to each other

### Arrays

- Explain how arrays are stored in memory
- Explain the runtimes for access, find, insert delete
- Give examples of when data is best modeled using an array


### Linked Lists

- Explain how linked lists are stored in memory
- Explain the runtimes for access, find, insert delete
- Give examples of when data is best modeled using a linked list

### Hashmaps

- Explain how hashmaps are stored in memory
- Explain the runtimes for access, find, insert delete
- Give examples of when data is best modeled using a hashmap


### Stacks

- Explain how a Stack can be implemented using an array
- Explain how a Stack can be implemented using a linked list
- Explain the runtimes for access, find, insert delete

### Queues

- Explain how a Queue can be implemented using a linked list
- Explain the runtimes for access, find, insert delete
- Give examples of when data is best modeled using a queue

### Recursion

- Explain what a base case is and what happens if you don't have one
- Explain why recursion can be a useful way to solve problems
- Solve problems using recursion (e.g multiply two numbers without using "*")

### Sorting Algorithms

- Explain how bubble sort and insertion sort work (n<sup>2</sup> sorts) 
- Explain how merge sort and quicksort work (nlog<sub>2</sub>(n) sorts)
- Determine what inputs to a sorting function will give it the worst case and best case runtimes

### Trees

- Traverse a tree using a breadth first search (bfs)
- Traverse a tree using a depth first search (dfs)
- Explain the runtimes for accessing, searching, inserting, and deleting elements into a binary search tree (BST)
- Give examples of when data is best modeled using a tree

### Graphs

- Explain the difference between weighted, unweighted, directed and undirected graphs
- Give examples of when data is best modeled using a graph

### Whiteboarding Questions

- Solve whiteboarding problems
