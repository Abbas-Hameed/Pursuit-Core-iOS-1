3. Write a function greatestCommonFactor(arr) take the array of numbers stored in arr which will always 
contain only two positive integers, and return the greatest common factor of them

>Input:1, 6  
>Output:1

4. Write a function that sums all the even indices of an array of Ints.
Input: [1, 2, 4, 5, 2]

Output: 7
</pre>

<pre>
5. Write a function named reverse that takes an array of integers named numbers as a parameter. The 
function should return an array with the numbers from numbers in reverse order.

Sample input: [1, 2, 3]

Sample output: [3, 2, 1]
</pre>

<pre>
6. Write a function that prints the numbers from 1 to x, except:
If the number if a multiple of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number If the number is a multiple of 5,
print "Buzz" instead of the number If the number is a multiple of 3 AND 5, print "FizzBuzz" instead of
the number Your function should take in one parameter: x (the number to count up to)
</pre>

<pre>
7. You are given an array of integers. The frequency of a number is the number of times it appears in
the array. Find out the frequency of each one. Print the numbers in ascending order followed by their
frequency.
var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 5, 2, 1, 3, 4, 2, 2, 2]
