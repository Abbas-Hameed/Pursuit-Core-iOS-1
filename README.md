# Access Code 3.2: Mobile Development with iOS

I hope the break and/or review is working out for you all. It's a good time for us to re-group,
rethink and retool. I'm looking forward to getting back with a fresh outlook and new moves. 

## Homework

1. https://github.com/C4Q/AC3.2-GameOfThrones
2. Complete the assessment project using the feedback you got on your PR. Feel free to 
team up with someone.

> **Note:**
>
> Be sure to get to this today because, as threatened by Tricky Ben, I'll be sending out 
> one or two assignments that will build on these.


On the other side of the break we'll enter Unit 3, where we'll be working with Networking and APIs,
a very interesting and essential part of mobile development.
